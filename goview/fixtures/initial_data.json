If you register your project, you can benefit from the scans and be informed about updates of your project's dependencies (API breakages, new symbols, depricated packages, etc.) or about changes and recommended updates in your spec files.<br/>\nTo register your project please fill in your email, project's homepage (github.com, bitbucket.org, ...) and package name. In \"Review request text\" field you can provide additional information about the package (regular changes in API, active upstream, under development, etc.) or ask questions about scans.
